PROPOSED SOLUTION
The proposed solution is to use a step-down transformer with a secondary output of 6V or 12V, along with diodes, a capacitor, a resistor, a switch, and a battery holder, to charge the battery and provide backup power to the LEDs. The LEDs will be connected in series and controlled by a push-button switch or toggle switch for easy operation. The circuit will automatically switch to battery power in the event of a power outage, ensuring reliable illumination during emergencies.
